# RStudioShortKeys
An addin package to complement RStudio by providing shortcut keys to commonly used functions (e.g. str, head, and tail) 

## Introduction
This package contains RStudio (>= 0.99.878) addins for commonly used functions (str, head, and tail). 

## Usage
After loading the package, user can then perform these steps as follows 

1. Highlight a variable or a section of the code, 
2. Click on Addins menu, 
3. Select either 'Call str', 'Call head' or 'Call tail'. 

User can also set their own keyboard shortcut keys for faster addin call.

## Testing
Code was developed using RStudio 0.99.896 using R-3.3.0 Win x64 and rstudioapi-0.5-1. 
RStudio should be as least >= 0.99.878 (for the addins) and rstudioapi has to be at least >= 0.5.1 (for sending code to console)
